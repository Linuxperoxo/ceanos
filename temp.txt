virtual adress -> page translation table -> physical address 

structure:
    1. top level page dir - points to page dir pointer table
    2. page dir pointer table - points to page tables
    3. page table - contains pointers to physical pages
	
each layer points to the one below it

translation:
- each level in the page hierarchy is indexed by a part of the virtual adress
- the os uses each portion of the virtual adress to find the next part of the page table; each level directs it to the next and the last level points to the physical adress
